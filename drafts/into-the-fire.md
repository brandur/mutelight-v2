Those of you that follow me on Twitter might have read that a few months ago I finally pulled the trigger and accepted a position down in San Francisco. For a software engineer, this is a somewhat symbolic act, moving from the country and into the industry's epicentre of learning and knowledge.

Before coming down I said to colleagues that I might be a reasonable developer up here, but I was moving down to SF to be the worst at the company. Of course I was mostly joking, and at the time didn't realize just how prophetic this statement would turn out to be.

Since coming out here I've run into situations a number of times where the discussion has turned so technical that I couldn't continue to contribute. This has never happened to me before in my life.
