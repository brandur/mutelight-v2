I can hear already you saying, "Hold on a second, what? But we all love Google!"

I can't agree enough. I love Google too, and would be crippled in the short term if I lost one of any number of its excellent services. The conjecture that I'd like to make is that Google can and even *needs* be beaten at its original core competency; its very first initiative from the time even before Larry and Sergey were a company: Google Search.

Google does an outstanding of most of its products, here are just a few that I use everyday, and would be happy to see stick around until the end of time:

* **Android:** first mobile platform to make you feel like your phone is working for you and not your telecom.

* **Gmail:** revolutionized e-mail, and early (2004!).

* **Reader:** great feed reader, and now a great ecosystem for third party app software to leverage.

* **Chrome:** proof that a great browser doesn't need to eat most of your memory and CPU to operate (I'm looking at you Firefox).

Despite making huge innovations in its many other initiatives, Google Search has fallen behind; ever fighting a losing battle against the miscreants of the world wide web.

The slide is certainly not due to a lack of effort on Google's part. In February 2011, Google released a major search algorithm change targeted specifically at spammy content farms from its index. By the time they finished tweaking the algorithm in April, results had noticeably improved and major farms like Demand Media's eHow had suffered a major blow to traffic.

Good, but Not Good Enough
-------------------------

For years Google's fundamentals have been understood.

Google has a policy of no manual intervention when it comes to their search index, so these garbage websites will only be removed if the algorithms can find sufficient reason to do so.
