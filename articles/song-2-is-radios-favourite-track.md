What do our friendly radio stations _really_ like about _Song 2_ though? Well, it's short. Clocking in at a mere 1:58, the stations can get some music out of the way before getting back to what they really enjoy: commercials, radio personalities reiterating day old stories that they found on Digg, and more commercials.
