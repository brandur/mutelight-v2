While working on getting our API restructured, I had to lookup how we want to respond to a client who has requested a format that we don't support. Is it a `406`? A `415`? Here are some plain English explanations:

* `406 Not acceptable` &mdash; In the context of format, when the server can't (or won't) respond in the format that the client has requested. This requested format could come in via an `Accept` header or an extension in the path.
* `415 Unsupported media type` &mdash; when the client has sent content in a request body that the server doesn't support. This would occur during a `POST` or `PUT` and may be described by the `Content-Type` header.

A user on Stack Overflow puts it as succinctly as possible: ["406 when you can't send what they want, and 415 when they send what you don't want."](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3294567).
